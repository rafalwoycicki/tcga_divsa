TCGA_DIVSA package
Dear all,
I am not R developer, I know that I have not done the test perfectly as you asked for. But it is working perfectly. I hope that you will like it even if it is not perfect.
I am using bash, Perl, Python scripting as well as R and R packages as a biologist to get the biological insights from omics data.
With this test, I have learned something new though it took me 2 days as I was making a R functions and R package for the first time.
This was the first time.
Sincerely,
Rafal Woycicki
